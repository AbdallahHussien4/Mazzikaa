The aim of this project is to develop a sheet music reader. This field is called Optical Music Recognition (OMR).\
Its objective is to convert sheet music to a machine-readable version.\
We take a simplified version where we convert an image of sheet music to a textual representation\
that can be further processed to produce midi files or audio files like wav or mp3.
